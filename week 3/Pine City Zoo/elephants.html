   <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
   <P>Elephants are the large mammals of the family elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditional
    recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant(Elephans maximus), although some
    evidence suggests that African bush elephant and African forest elephant are separate species (L.africana and L.
    cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southest Asia.
    Elephants is the only surviving family of order Proboscidea; other' now extinct, member of the order include
    deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial
    animals and can reach a height of 4m (13 ft) AND weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).</P>
   <p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for
    many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting
    water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve
    as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear
    flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry
    their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while
    Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>

   <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including
    savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
