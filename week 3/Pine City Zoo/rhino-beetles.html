   <h3>RHINO-BEETLES</h3>
   <p>Rhino beetles, also known as rhinoceros beetles, are a group of large beetles belonging to the family
    Scarabaeidae. They
    are named after the horn-like protrusions on the males' heads, which resemble the horns of a rhinoceros. Rhino
    beetles
    are found in various parts of the world, with the majority of species concentrated in tropical regions.</p>
   <p>These beetles are known for their impressive size and strength, with some species reaching lengths of up to six
    inches
    (15 cm). They have a robust body structure and powerful jaws that they use for feeding and defense. Male rhino
    beetles
    typically have larger horns than females, which they use to attract mates and compete with other males.</p>
   <p>Rhino beetles are primarily herbivores, feeding on decaying wood, fruits, and sap. They play important roles in
    ecosystems by breaking down organic matter and aiding in nutrient recycling. Some species are also considered pests
    in
    agriculture, as their larvae can cause damage to crops by feeding on plant roots.</p>
   <p>In some cultures, rhino beetles are considered symbols of strength and power, and are sometimes kept as pets or
    used in
    insect fighting competitions. These beetles have also been popular as pets in the exotic pet trade, with enthusiasts
    appreciating their unique appearance and behaviors. Overall, rhino beetles are fascinating insects that play
    important roles in their ecosystems and have a cultural
    significance in various parts of the world.</p>
