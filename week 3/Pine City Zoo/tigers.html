   <h3>TIGERS</h3>
   <p>Tigers are the largest member of the cat family and are known for their distinctive orange coats with black
    strips. They are native to various parts of Asia, including India, Russia, China, ans Southern Asia. They are apex
    predators and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems.There are several subspecies of
    tigers, with the most well-known being the Bengal tiger, found primarily in India and Bangladesh. Other subspecies
    include the Siberian tiger, Indochinese tiger, Sumatran tiger ana
    Malayan tiger.</p>
   <p>Tigers are solitary animals and are known for their strength, agility, and powerful hunting skills. They are
    carnivores
    and primarily prey on large mammals such as deer, wild boar, and buffalo. Tigers are capable of taking down prey
    much
    larger than themselves.
    Unfortunately, tigers are classified as endangered species, with populations declining due to habitat loss,
    poaching,
    and human-wildlife conflict.
   <p> Conservation efforts are being made to protect and preserve tiger populations, including
    establishing protected areas, anti-poaching measures, and community-based conservation initiatives.
    Tigers have a significant cultural and spiritual significance in many Asian cultures, symbolizing power, strength,
    and protection.
    They are often featured in art, folklore, and myths across various countries.</p>
